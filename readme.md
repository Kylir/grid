# Grid

## Goals

This simple application has two goals:

+ Serve as a React + Redux starting point for the future.
+ Help me to create nice visualizations with my [LED matrix timer gadget](https://github.com/Kylir/timer-ht16k33-8x8-led-matrix).


## How to use

+ Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Kylir/grid.git`
+ Install the dependencies: `npm run install`
+ Start the dev server: `npm start`


## In the future

+ Add tests! Jest + Enzyme would be nice.
+ Add a new component to display the C code to display the state of the matrix.
+ Add a server side part?
+ Add an authentication layer?
